# SMB
This one was fun. SMB is a surprisingly universal network protocol with amazing configurability. 


## Why is SMB surprisingly universal? 
Because, unlike many applications and networking protocols, SMB has no macOS or Linux alternative. It is the same for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Video streaming is even possible from server to client, which is amazing.

Below is a list of Bash, PowerShell & Ansible Scripts I made with links to their repos down below:
