Hi, my dear reader! My name is Derek. I am certainly a contrarian by nature, who is absolutely in love with software engineering and automation. I love to create holistic projects and do things once and for all (i.e., Automation).

I am currently updating my digital presence as well as re-engineering all my <b>automation scripts</b> for <b>universal use</b> so that people who read my blog can benefit from them. 

I also do freelancing at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ec2a30edf72547c5?mp_source=share) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/dereknnaji). But, I would prefer if you would contact me directly via my [Gmail](mailto:dereknnaji@gmail.com) if you are in need of my services.

Since you came all the way here to my website, might I interest you in my [blog?](/blog/:year/:title/) Or, perhaps, you might be interested in seeing my [projects?](/projects/)

* <b>Some of my ongoing works:</b>
  - Creating a series on SMB, DNS, DHCP & more on my Blog
  - Making a tutorial for efficiently using PowerShell, Bash & Ansible on my Blog
  - Creating an ERP/Inventory & Asset Management/Security Platform for Small Businesses
  - Creating a few Simple Mobile Apps
    - Creating a Local 2-Factor Auth Workflow
    - Examining my code for security vulnerabilities

<b>If you need my help with anything, please contace me without hesitation!</b>
